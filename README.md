# Code Refactor Completed Assignment
Code was provided for a functional and laid-out website with HTML and CSS.
I cleaned up with HTML by using semantic headers instead of generic div blocks.
Also, I cleaned up the CSS by using IDs and classes only when appropriate.
All changes made to preserve code functionality while updating the code to accessibility standards.
